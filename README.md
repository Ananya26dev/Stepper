# Stepper in React.js

The stepper project in React.js is a multi-step form component that visually guides users through a series of steps in a sequential process, such as checkout, registration, or any multi-step workflow. The component highlights the current step, shows completed steps, and includes a progress bar that visually represents the user's progress. It dynamically renders each step's content based on the user's current position in the workflow, providing an interactive and user-friendly experience.
